84  "I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later."	Epictectus
85  Education has no goal more important than bringing our preconception of what is reasonable and unreasonable in alignment with nature.	Epictectus
86  "Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for God’s sake, don’t sell it cheap."	Epictectus
87  "What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?"	Epictectus
88  "If from the moment they get up in the morning they adhere to their ideals, eating and bathing like a person of integrity, putting their principles into practice in every situation they face – the way a runner does when he applies the principles of running, or a singer those of musicianship – that is where you will see true progress embodied, and find someone who has not wasted their time making the journey here from home."	Epictectus
89  "What else are tragedies but the ordeals of people who have come to value externals, tricked out in tragic verse?"	Epictetus
90  "If a man objects to truths that are all too evident, it is no easy task finding arguments that will change his mind. This is proof neither of his own strength nor of his teacher’s weakness. When someone caught in an argument hardens to stone, there is just no more reasoning with them."	Epictectus
91  "Most of us dread the deadening of the body and will do anything to avoid it. About the deadening of the soul, however, we don’t care one iota."	Epictectus
92  "We pity the mentally retarded, and students with learning difficulties. But if somebody’s sense of shame and respect are dead, we will actually call this determination."	Epictectus
93  "And so it is inexcusable for man to begin and end where the beasts do. He should begin where they do, but only end where nature left off dealing with him; which is to say, in contemplation and understanding."	Epictectus
94  "“But my nose is running!” What do you have hands for, idiot, if not to wipe it? “But how is it right that there be running noses in the first place?” Instead of thinking up protests, wouldn’t it be easier just to wipe your nose?"	Epictectus
95  "For what does reason purport to do? “Establish what is true, eliminate what is false and suspend judgement in doubtful cases.” … What else does reason prescribe? “To accept the consequence of what has been admitted to be correct.”"	Epictectus
96  "Why are we still lazy, indifferent and dull? Why do we look for excuses to avoid training and exercising our powers of reason? “Look, if I err in such matters I haven’t killed my father, have I?” No, fool – for there was no father there for you to kill! What did you do instead? You made the only mistake you had the opportunity to make."	Epictectus
97  "I mean, are these the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the Capitol? But to use one’s impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a word, to fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees with your position and what conflicts – is nothing wrong in all of that?"	Epictectus
98  "Don’t confuse qualities that are found in the same writer only incidentally. If Plato had been strong and handsome, should I also try to become strong and handsome, as if this were essential to philosophy, since there was one particular philosopher who combined philosophy with good looks?"	Epictectus
99  "Ask me what the real good in man’s case is, and I can only say that it is the right kind of moral character."	Epictectus
100 "Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too — ready to understand heaven and earth."	Marcus Aurelius
101 "It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own."	Marcus Aurelius
102 "However much you possess there's someone else who has more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to the exact extent to which you lag behind him."	Seneca
103 Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those who are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach.	Seneca
104 "Let us therefore go all out to make the most of friends, since no one can tell how long we shall have the opportunity."	Seneca
105 “Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.”	Marcus Aurelius
106 “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”	Marcus Aurelius
107 “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”	Marcus Aurelius
108 “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”	Marcus Aurelius
109 “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”	Marcus Aurelius
110 “Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.”	Marcus Aurelius

112 “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”	Marcus Aurelius

114 “Our life is what our thoughts make it.”	Marcus Aurelius
115 “It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.”	Marcus Aurelius
116 “If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”	Marcus Aurelius
117 “The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.”	Marcus Aurelius
118 “If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”	Marcus Aurelius
119 “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.”	Marcus Aurelius
120 “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”	Marcus Aurelius
121 “I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.”	Marcus Aurelius
122 “Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.”	Marcus Aurelius
123 “Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.”	Marcus Aurelius
124 “The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.”	Marcus Aurelius
125 “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”	Marcus Aurelius
126 “The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.”	Marcus Aurelius
127 “When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.”	Marcus Aurelius
128 “Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.”	Marcus Aurelius
129 “Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.”	Marcus Aurelius
130 “Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?”	Marcus Aurelius
131 “How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.”	Marcus Aurelius
132 Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not 'This is misfortune,' but 'To bear this worthily is good fortune.'	Marcus Aurelius
133 “You are a little soul carrying about a corpse.”	Epictetus
134 “Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.”	Marcus Aurelius
135 “Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.”	Marcus Aurelius
136 “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”	Marcus Aurelius
137 “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”	Marcus Aurelius
138 “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”	Marcus Aurelius
139 “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”	Marcus Aurelius
140 “Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.”	Marcus Aurelius
141 “When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...”	Marcus Aurelius
142 “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”	Marcus Aurelius

144 “Our life is what our thoughts make it.”	Marcus Aurelius
145 “It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.”	Marcus Aurelius
146 “If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”	Marcus Aurelius
147 “The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.”	Marcus Aurelius
148 “If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”	Marcus Aurelius
149 “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.”	Marcus Aurelius
150 “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”	Marcus Aurelius
151 “I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.”	Marcus Aurelius

154 “The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.”	Marcus Aurelius
155 “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”	Marcus Aurelius
156 “The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.”	Marcus Aurelius
157 “When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.”	Marcus Aurelius
158 “Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.”	Marcus Aurelius
159 “Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.”	Marcus Aurelius
160 “Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?”	Marcus Aurelius
161 “How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.”	Marcus Aurelius
162 Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not 'This is misfortune,' but 'To bear this worthily is good fortune.'	Marcus Aurelius
163 “You are a little soul carrying about a corpse.”	Epictetus
164 “Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.”	Marcus Aurelius
165 Some things are within your power, and some are not.	Epictetus
166 If it concerns anything beyond your power, it is nothing to you.	Epictetus
167 Restrain desire. Where it is necessary for you to pursue something, do so with discretion and moderation.	Epictetus
168 Reject only the undesirable things which you can control.	Epictetus
169 With regard to things which delight the mind, remind yourself of what nature they are.	Epictetus
170 When you perform any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is.	Epictetus
171 You are not disturbed by things. Your views on those things disturb you. Do not attribute your distress to others, but to yourself and to your own views.	Epictetus
172 Do not feel pride in any achievement not immediately your own.	Epictetus
173 Things will not always happen as you want them to happen. Realize that they happen as they happen.	Epictetus
174 Sickness harms the body, not the will. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens.	Epictetus
175 Upon every misfortune, turn toward yourself and ask which of your faculties may offer a solution. If pain, then strength; if insult, then patience. Existence will not overwhelm you.	Epictetus
176 It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation.	Epictetus
177 There is a price paid for peace and tranquility; and nothing is to be had for nothing.	Epictetus
178 Be content to show foolishness and dullness on the exterior. Do not desire to be thought to know anything.	Epictetus
179 If you wish your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so. Exercise only what is in your power.	Epictetus
180 Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Has it not yet come? Wait till it reaches you.	Epictetus
181 In conversation, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to others and, if need be, to groan with them. Take heed not to groan inwardly.	Epictetus
182 You are an actor in a drama. Act well the part.	Epictetus
183 You are unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer.	Epictetus
184 When you see anyone eminent in honors or power, be careful not to be confused by appearances and to pronounce them happy.	Epictetus
185  Do not desire to be held in high regard by your peers, but to be free. The only way to this is a disregard of things which do not within our own power.	Epictetus
186 Remember that it is not the person who gives abuse or blows, who insults, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When you are provoked it is your own opinion which provokes you.	Epictetus
187 Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes. You will never entertain an abject thought, nor covet anything.	Epictetus
188 If you have a desire towards something, prepare yourself from the first to have the multitude laugh and sneer. If you are persistent, those persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you.	Epictetus
189 If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything.	Epictetus
190 Is anyone preferred before you at anything? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that they have them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you do not have them.	Epictetus
191 If a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would be angry.	Epictetus
192 Do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be confounded.	Epictetus
193 In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will desist.	Epictetus
194 You will be everything, but nothing in earnest. You mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. You have never entered upon anything considerately, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Consider first what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. You must be one thing. You must cultivate your own reason and apply yourself to things within you.	Epictetus
195 Begin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, one you may preserve both alone and in company.	Epictetus
196 Be silent, or speak what is needful, and in few words. You may enter into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it. Let it not run into any of the common subjects, and especially not on other people, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons.	Epictetus
197 Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.	Epictetus
198 Avoid taking oaths as far as you are able.	Epictetus
199 Avoid public and vulgar entertainment. If ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon your mind, that you may not slide into vulgarity.	Epictetus
200 Provide things relating to the body no further than absolute need requires. Cut off those things which lean toward show and luxury.	Epictetus
201 Be not uncharitable or severe to those who seem evil, nor boast that you yourself live otherwise.	Epictetus
202 If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you. Answer: “They were ignorant of my other faults, else they would not have mentioned these alone..	Epictetus
203 It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles. If ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, wish things to be only just as they are, for thus nothing will go against you. Abstain from derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed.	Epictetus
204 Be not prompt or ready to attend private functions. If you must attend, preserve your dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable.	Epictetus
205 When you are going before anyone in power, the doors may not be opened to you, and they may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens.	Epictetus
206 In company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. Avoid attempts to excite laughter, for this may slide you into vulgarity and may lower you in the esteem of your acquaintances. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous.	Epictetus
207 If you are enticed by promised pleasure, let the affair wait your leisure. Bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that after you have enjoyed it.	Epictetus
208 When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, do it, even though the world should misunderstand it. If you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself. If you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you.	Epictetus
209 At a feast, to choose the largest share is suitable to the bodily appetite, but inconsistent with the social spirit. When you eat with another, value the bodies of those things which are set before you, and your courtesy toward your host.	Epictetus
210 If you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have lost one which you might have supported.	Epictetus
211 Take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. If you were to guard against this in every action, you should enter upon those actions more safely.	Epictetus
212 It is a mark of ignorance to spend much time in things relating to the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, and in eating and drinking. These things should be done with discretion and your main strength be applied to your reason.	Epictetus
213 When any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that they act or speak from an impression that it is right for them to do so. If they judge from false appearances, they are the person hurt and the person deceived. You will bear with a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to them..	Epictetus
