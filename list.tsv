Does the captain of a ship manage it better by not attending?	Epictetus
"Don’t wait for Plato’s Republic! Rather, be content if one tiny thing makes some progress, and reflect on the fact that what results from this tiny thing is no tiny thing at all!"	Marcus Aurelius 
Every day I plead the case against myself as judge.	Seneca
"Every hour focus your mind attentively on the performance of the task in hand, with dignity, human sympathy, benevolence and freedom, and leave aside all other thoughts. You will achieve this, if you perform each action as if it were your last."	Marcus Aurelius
Fate permitting.	Marcus Aurelius

It is not death that a man should fear. But he should fear never beginning to live.	Marcus Aurelius
It is possible for you to retreat into yourself whenever you please. 	Marcus Aurelius
It is within my power to derive benefit from every experience. 	Epictetus
It seemed so to him.	Epictetus

What thing is done better by those who are inattentive?	Epictetus

Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty is left undone?	Epictetus
Will your fate. 	Epictetus
"Yes, indeed, I shall use the old road, but if I find a shorter and easier one I shall open it up. The men who pioneered the old routes are leaders, not our masters. Truth lies open to every one.

You see how few are the things that a person needs to master if he is to live a tranquil and divine life.	Marcus Aurelius

"No one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself."	Seneca
No one is a laughing-stock who laughs first at himself.	Seneca
"Just as it is not the last drop that stops the water-clock but every drop that has previously fallen, so the last hour when we cease to exist is not the only one to cause death but the only one to complete it: we reach death then but we have been coming to it for a long time."	Seneca
"You are mistaken if you think that luxury, neglect of good manners, and other vices of which each man accuses the age in which he lives, are especially characteristic of our own epoch; no, they are the vices of mankind and not of the times."	Seneca
What decides whether a sum of money is good? The money is not going to tell you; it must be the faculty that makes use of such impressions – reason.	Epictectus

"What should we do then? Make the best use of what is in our power, and treat the rest in accordance with its nature."	Epictectus
"What should we have ready at hand in a situation like this? The knowledge of what is mine and what is not mine, what I can and cannot do."	Epictectus
‘I will throw you into prison.’ ‘Correction – it is my body you will throw there.’	Epictectus
"I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later."	Epictectus
Education has no goal more important than bringing our preconception of what is reasonable and unreasonable in alignment with nature.	Epictectus
"Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for God’s sake, don’t sell it cheap."	Epictectus
"What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?"	Epictectus
"If from the moment they get up in the morning they adhere to their ideals, eating and bathing like a person of integrity, putting their principles into practice in every situation they face – the way a runner does when he applies the principles of running, or a singer those of musicianship – that is where you will see true progress embodied, and find someone who has not wasted their time making the journey here from home."	Epictectus
"What else are tragedies but the ordeals of people who have come to value externals, tricked out in tragic verse?"	Epictetus
"If a man objects to truths that are all too evident, it is no easy task finding arguments that will change his mind. This is proof neither of his own strength nor of his teacher’s weakness. When someone caught in an argument hardens to stone, there is just no more reasoning with them."	Epictectus
"Most of us dread the deadening of the body and will do anything to avoid it. About the deadening of the soul, however, we don’t care one iota."	Epictectus
"We pity the mentally retarded, and students with learning difficulties. But if somebody’s sense of shame and respect are dead, we will actually call this determination."	Epictectus
"And so it is inexcusable for man to begin and end where the beasts do. He should begin where they do, but only end where nature left off dealing with him; which is to say, in contemplation and understanding."	Epictectus
"“But my nose is running!” What do you have hands for, idiot, if not to wipe it? “But how is it right that there be running noses in the first place?” Instead of thinking up protests, wouldn’t it be easier just to wipe your nose?"	Epictectus
"For what does reason purport to do? “Establish what is true, eliminate what is false and suspend judgement in doubtful cases.” … What else does reason prescribe? “To accept the consequence of what has been admitted to be correct.”"	Epictectus
"Why are we still lazy, indifferent and dull? Why do we look for excuses to avoid training and exercising our powers of reason? “Look, if I err in such matters I haven’t killed my father, have I?” No, fool – for there was no father there for you to kill! What did you do instead? You made the only mistake you had the opportunity to make."	Epictectus
"I mean, are these the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the Capitol? But to use one’s impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a word, to fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees with your position and what conflicts – is nothing wrong in all of that?"	Epictectus
"Don’t confuse qualities that are found in the same writer only incidentally. If Plato had been strong and handsome, should I also try to become strong and handsome, as if this were essential to philosophy, since there was one particular philosopher who combined philosophy with good looks?"	Epictectus
"Ask me what the real good in man’s case is, and I can only say that it is the right kind of moral character."	Epictectus
"Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too — ready to understand heaven and earth."	Marcus Aurelius
"It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own."	Marcus Aurelius
"However much you possess there's someone else who has more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to the exact extent to which you lag behind him."	Seneca
Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those who are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach.	Seneca
"Let us therefore go all out to make the most of friends, since no one can tell how long we shall have the opportunity."	Seneca

“The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”	Marcus Aurelius
“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Our life is what our thoughts make it.”	Marcus Aurelius
“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.”	Marcus Aurelius
“If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”	Marcus Aurelius
“The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.”	Marcus Aurelius
“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.”	Marcus Aurelius
“The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”	Marcus Aurelius
“I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.”	Marcus Aurelius
“The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.”	Marcus Aurelius
“How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”	Marcus Aurelius
“The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.”	Marcus Aurelius
“When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?”
“How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.”	Marcus Aurelius
“Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.”	Marcus Aurelius
“You are a little soul carrying about a corpse.”	Epictetus
“Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.”	Marcus Aurelius

Some things are within your power, and some are not.	Epictetus
If it concerns anything beyond your power, it is nothing to you.	Epictetus
Restrain desire. Where it is necessary for you to pursue something, do so with discretion and moderation.	Epictetus
Reject only the undesirable things which you can control.	Epictetus
With regard to things which delight the mind, remind yourself of what nature they are.	Epictetus
When you perform any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is.	Epictetus
You are not disturbed by things. Your views on those things disturb you. Do not attribute your distress to others, but to yourself and to your own views.	Epictetus
Do not feel pride in any achievement not immediately your own.	Epictetus
Things will not always happen as you want them to happen. Realize that they happen as they happen.	Epictetus
Sickness harms the body, not the will. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens.	Epictetus
Upon every misfortune, turn toward yourself and ask which of your faculties may offer a solution. If pain, then strength; if insult, then patience. Existence will not overwhelm you.	Epictetus
It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation.	Epictetus
There is a price paid for peace and tranquility; and nothing is to be had for nothing.	Epictetus
Be content to show foolishness and dullness on the exterior. Do not desire to be thought to know anything.	Epictetus
If you wish your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so. Exercise only what is in your power.	Epictetus
Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Has it not yet come? Wait till it reaches you.	Epictetus
In conversation, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to others and, if need be, to groan with them. Take heed not to groan inwardly.	Epictetus
You are an actor in a drama. Act well the part.	Epictetus
You are unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer.	Epictetus
When you see anyone eminent in honors or power, be careful not to be confused by appearances and to pronounce them happy.	Epictetus
Do not desire to be held in high regard by your peers, but to be free. The only way to this is a disregard of things which do not within our own power.	Epictetus
Remember that it is not the person who gives abuse or blows, who insults, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When you are provoked it is your own opinion which provokes you.	Epictetus
Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes. You will never entertain an abject thought, nor covet anything.	Epictetus
If you have a desire towards something, prepare yourself from the first to have the multitude laugh and sneer. If you are persistent, those persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you.	Epictetus
If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything.	Epictetus
Is anyone preferred before you at anything? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that they have them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you do not have them.	Epictetus
If a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would be angry.	Epictetus
Do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be confounded.	Epictetus
In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will desist.	Epictetus
You will be everything, but nothing in earnest. You mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. You have never entered upon anything considerately, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Consider first what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. You must be one thing. You must cultivate your own reason and apply yourself to things within you.	Epictetus
Begin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, one you may preserve both alone and in company.	Epictetus
Be silent, or speak what is needful, and in few words. You may enter into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it. Let it not run into any of the common subjects, and especially not on other people, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons.	Epictetus
Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.	Epictetus
Avoid taking oaths as far as you are able.	Epictetus
Avoid public and vulgar entertainment. If ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon your mind, that you may not slide into vulgarity.	Epictetus
Provide things relating to the body no further than absolute need requires. Cut off those things which lean toward show and luxury.	Epictetus
Be not uncharitable or severe to those who seem evil, nor boast that you yourself live otherwise.	Epictetus
If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you. Answer: “They were ignorant of my other faults, else they would not have mentioned these alone..	Epictetus
It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles. If ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, wish things to be only just as they are, for thus nothing will go against you. Abstain from derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed.	Epictetus
Be not prompt or ready to attend private functions. If you must attend, preserve your dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable.	Epictetus
When you are going before anyone in power, the doors may not be opened to you, and they may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens.	Epictetus
In company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. Avoid attempts to excite laughter, for this may slide you into vulgarity and may lower you in the esteem of your acquaintances. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous.	Epictetus
If you are enticed by promised pleasure, let the affair wait your leisure. Bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that after you have enjoyed it.	Epictetus
When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, do it, even though the world should misunderstand it. If you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself. If you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you.	Epictetus
At a feast, to choose the largest share is suitable to the bodily appetite, but inconsistent with the social spirit. When you eat with another, value the bodies of those things which are set before you, and your courtesy toward your host.	Epictetus
If you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have lost one which you might have supported.	Epictetus
Take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. If you were to guard against this in every action, you should enter upon those actions more safely.	Epictetus
It is a mark of ignorance to spend much time in things relating to the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, and in eating and drinking. These things should be done with discretion and your main strength be applied to your reason.	Epictetus
When any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that they act or speak from an impression that it is right for them to do so. If they judge from false appearances, they are the person hurt and the person deceived. You will bear with a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to them..	Epictetus
These reasonings have no logical connection: “I am richer than you, therefore I am your superior.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am your superior.” The true logical connection is this: “I am richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.” But you, after all, consist neither in property nor in style.	Epictetus
Does anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that they do it ill, but hastily. Does anyone drink much wine? Do not say that they do ill, but that they drink a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand their motives, how should you know if they act ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances except those you fully comprehend.	Epictetus
Do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you ought. Do not make an exhibition before the ignorant of your principles.	Epictetus
When you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not build yourself upon it. If you drink water, refrain from saying upon every occasion, “I drink water..	Epictetus
Consider how much more frugal are the poor are, and how much more patient of hardship.	Epictetus
The vulgar look outwards for all help or harm.	Epictetus
The philosopher looks inwards for all help or harm.	Epictetus
Those proficient praise no one, blame no one, and accuse no one. They say nothing concerning their self as being anybody or knowing anything.	Epictetus
When you are hindered, accuse yourself. If you are praised, smile to yourself at the person who praises you.	Epictetus
Whatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws.	Epictetus
Do not regard what anyone says of you, for this is no concern of yours.	Epictetus
How long will you delay to demand of yourself improvements? You have received the principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. If you will be negligent and slothful, you will accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind.	Epictetus
This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a realized human being. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law.	Epictetus
If any instance of pain or pleasure be set before you, remember that now is the combat, and that by one failure or success, honor may be lost or won. And though you are not yet proficient, you ought to live as one seeking to be proficient.	Epictetus
